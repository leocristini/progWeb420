# progWeb420

To get the full project:
From terminal: git init (must be inside the folder that will become the project folder)
               git clone <link> (the link is taken from the progWeb420 repository)

Now that you got the project, if it's not working check the Apache Tomcat version (need 8.0.x +)
And check the user and password in the web.xml file (these might be different and cause deployment errors)
